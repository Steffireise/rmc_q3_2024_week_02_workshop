# Non-Communicable Disease Burden (NCD)

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here, janitor)

# Import the non-communicable diseases data
data_ncd <- read_csv(here("data/burden-of-disease-ncd.csv"))
```

```{r}
# Filter the dataset to include only the three countries chosen by your group.

d <- data_ncd %>% filter(Entity %in% c("Canada","Germany", "India"))

```


## Table of Estimates for NCD Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries. 
# You should pivot the data to show each country in a separate column.
# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.

dt <- d %>% select(-Code) %>% clean_names() 

dt<- dt %>% rename(daly="dal_ys_disability_adjusted_life_years_non_communicable_diseases_sex_both_age_age_standardized_rate")

wide <- dt %>% pivot_wider(values_from=daly, names_from=entity)

kable(wide)
```

## Plot Showing Trends in NCD Burden Over Time 

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.

dt %>% ggplot(aes(y=daly, x=year, group=entity, col=entity)) +
  geom_line() 

```

## Summary of NCD Burden Findings

The DALY is decreasing over time from 1990 to 2020. India has the highest DALY compared to Germany and Canada. Canada has the lowest DALY.
